The D&D Character Creator Lite is a website where you can create a user account then create new D&D 5e characters selecting their armor, weapons, items, name, race, gender, background, class and stats.  After submitting, it will take all that data into account and generate a character profile with your stat modifiers, armor class, and hit points calculated including any bonuses.  Also, you may view other users or characters that have been made.
